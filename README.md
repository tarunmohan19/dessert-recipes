Title: Dessert Recipes from the Great Depression

Description:

This project is a website that has a list of recipes for popular desserts
during the Great Depression. It was built as part of the curriculum for 
The Odin Project. It's a static site devloped using only HTML. In the future, 
I hope to add more stylistic elements and create more user interactivity.
Additionally, I hope to add more recipes to the site.
