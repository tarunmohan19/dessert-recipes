    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>As its name suggests the Poor Man's Cake was intended to be a sweet treat that could be enjoyed at
        a low cost. Thus, it was quite popular during the Depression era as many families were in a position
        where keeping costs low was a priority. This dish while not having many ingredients found in the 
        traditional cake still provides amazing flavor!
